# Don't Wanna!

![Don't Wanna](dontwanna.png)

This is a silly app for creating to-dos and logging rental listings. I made it for myself and my partner to use while we manage a complicated move.

## Roadmap

- Feature to ask "why" you don't want to do something, to help with thinking through blockers or working through emotional obstacles
- Auto-reload after checking off a to-do(n't)
- A way to automatically check if listings have been taken down
