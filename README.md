# Don't Wanna!

![Don't Wanna](dontwanna.png)

This is a silly app for creating to-dos and logging rental listings. I made it for myself and my partner to use while we manage a complicated move.

Sometimes, you just feel like you don't want to do things! I like to think leaning into that (playfully) can help, hence the concept of a to-don't. Surprisingly, this *has* helped me get more done. 

## Roadmap

- Feature to ask "why" you don't want to do something, to help with thinking through blockers or working through emotional obstacles.
- Auto-reload after checking off a to-do(n't).
- A way to automatically check if listings have been taken down.
